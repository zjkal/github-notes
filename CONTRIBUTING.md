# Contributing to GitHub Notes

We love your input! We want to make contributing to GitHub Notes as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards.
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly.
4. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs or added features.
5. **Ensure your code follows** the existing style.
6. **Issue a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Chrome 88+ or Microsoft Edge 88+
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and browser extensions

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zjkal/github-notes.git
   cd github-notes
   ```

2. **Load the extension in your browser**
   - Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder

3. **Make your changes**

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables and functions)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Handle errors gracefully

### CSS
- Use consistent class naming (kebab-case)
- Follow GitHub's design patterns
- Ensure responsive design
- Use CSS custom properties for theming

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Support internationalization with `data-i18n` attributes

## Internationalization

When adding new text strings:

1. **Add the key to both language files**:
   - `_locales/en/messages.json`
   - `_locales/zh_CN/messages.json`

2. **Use the i18n system in your code**:
   ```javascript
   // In JavaScript
   const text = chrome.i18n.getMessage('yourKey');
   
   // In HTML
   <span data-i18n="yourKey">Default text</span>
   ```

3. **Follow the existing message format**:
   ```json
   {
     "yourKey": {
       "message": "Your message text",
       "description": "Description of when this message is used"
     }
   }
   ```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test on different GitHub repository pages
- Verify functionality in both Chrome and Edge
- Test with different screen sizes
- Verify internationalization works correctly
- Test import/export functionality

### Test Cases to Cover
- Adding notes to repositories
- Editing existing notes
- Deleting notes
- Searching notes in popup
- Exporting and importing data
- Settings changes
- Language switching
